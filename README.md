What is GatherContent?

GatherContent is an online platform for pulling together, editing, and reviewing website content with your clients and colleagues. It's a reliable alternative to emailing around Word documents and pasting content into your CMS. This plugin replaces that process of copying and pasting content and allows you to bulk import structured content, and then continue to update it in Kentico with a few clicks.

Connecting a powerful content production platform, to a powerful content publishing platform.
